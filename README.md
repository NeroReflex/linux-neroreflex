# Linux kernel based on ArchLinux and patched for ChimeraOS

We aim to provide early access to some upstream patches and some compatibility
fixes we discover and test. Yet we try to provide a stable experience.

This repository will use a PKGBUILD to build ArchLinux packages and publish
them as GitHub releases in binary package form. We currently do not provide a
custom ArchLinux repository.
